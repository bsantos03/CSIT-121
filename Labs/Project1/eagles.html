                <h1>Favorite Sports Team:</h1>
                <p>Philadelphia Eagles has been my favorite NFL team for 12 years from now.&nbspThis team become my favorite team when I first noticed the former QB Michael Vick, I instantly fell in love with the way he was able to finesse through the field with his explosive runs.&nbspLucky, I have been to a few Eagles game, even went to a few this past season. &nbspSadly, they did not make it far...This page is dedicated to the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>
