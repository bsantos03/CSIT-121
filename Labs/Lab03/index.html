        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves of minced garlic</li>
            <li>24 ounces of tomato sauce </li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella</li> 
            <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat until the beef is browned.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato sauce to the skillet with the beef and let it simmer for roughly around 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Drain and rinse with cold water</li>
            <li>Now, in a different bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Layer a thin platform of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Just a layer enough to cover the meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread ricotta cheese mixture on top of the noodles.</li>
            <li>Repeat layering the meat sauce, lasagna, and cheese. Stacking each other on top of each other.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a cup of mozzarella cheese on top of the final layer.</li>
            <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
