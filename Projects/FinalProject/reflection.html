                    After completing this project, I can now reflect on the most challenging aspects of this assignment and the easier parts that allowed me to create this website. First, starting off with the challenges, a challenge I experienced was getting the responsiveness of the website to work, when I was trying to get it to view properly on a mobile device. Getting the layout to work on a mobile device took a few days of trial and error. Another challenge I encountered was getting the table in the home page to fit properly while also having some separation for the route of the trip to be right under the table without having any issues of overlapping. When I was validating my code, I noticed that the fig caption needed to be in a figure tag, I made the mistake of not creating the figure tag and just leaving the fig caption tag inside of the div class.  A triumph I would say was creating the form, the multiple pages while also having the activities side by side, with a description of what each activity represents.

                    Working with a mobile device screen and a regular monitor screen is difficult to work with, but with a few tweaks and different approaches I was able to get it to work properly. What I learned in this class is an amazing starting point to continue developing and designing websites. Starting off with just simple ‘Hello World’ to now having a full-blown website is insane to me. The information I gained from this class will be used to design a website that will showcase my skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as having my resume attached so future employers can view that. I also want to work on other personal projects, so that I can practice more and expand my knowledge in web development.
