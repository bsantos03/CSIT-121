        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1 chopped onion</li>
            <li>3 cloves of minced garlic</li>
            <li>24 ounces of tomato sauce </li>
            <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>Ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella</li> 
            <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            </li>
        </ul>
            <ol>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit.</ol>
            <ol>2. Cook the ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat until the beef is browned.</ol>
            <ol>3. Add the tomato sauce to the skillet with the beef and let it simmer for roughly around 10 to 15 minutes.</ol>
            <ol>4. Cook the lasagna noodles</ol>
            <ol>5. Drain and rinse with cold water</ol>
            <ol>6. Now, in a different bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.</ol>
            <ol>7. Layer a thin platform of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.</ol>
            <ol>8. Place lasagna noodles on top of the sauce. Just a layer enough to cover the meat sauce.</ol>
            <ol>9. Spread ricotta cheese mixture on top of the noodles.</ol>
            <ol>10. Repeat layering the meat sauce, lasagna, and cheese. Stacking each other on top of each other.</ol>
            <ol>11. Sprinkle a cup of mozzarella cheese on top of the final layer.</ol>
            <ol>12. Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.</ol>
            <ol>13. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25-30 minutes, until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</ol>
